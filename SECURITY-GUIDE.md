# Security Improvements for JuniorCV Backend

This document outlines the security improvements implemented for the JuniorCV backend application.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Protection Against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

- Added `sanitizeMiddleware.js` to sanitize all input data
- Implemented using `xss` and `sanitize-html` libraries
- All user inputs are sanitized before processing

### 2. Protection Against SQL/NoSQL Injection

- Added input validation using `express-validator`
- Created comprehensive validation rules for all auth endpoints
- MongoDB queries use proper field names and types, avoiding direct user input

### 3. Rate Limiting

- Implemented rate limiting with `express-rate-limit`
- General rate limiting for all API endpoints (100 requests per 15 minutes)
- Stricter rate limiting for auth endpoints (10 requests per hour)

### 4. Security Headers

- Added `helmet` to set security headers
- Protection against clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, XSS
- Added proper content security policy

### 5. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

- Restricted CORS to specific origins in production
- Configured to only allow trusted domains in production
- Full CORS configuration with methods and headers

### 6. Input Validation

- Implemented comprehensive input validation with `express-validator`
- Added validation for all user inputs
- Custom validation rules for email, phone, and password

### 7. Improved Password Security

- Added password strength requirements
- Requires minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
- Proper password hashing with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)

### 8. Authentication Enhancements

- Improved JWT token validation
- Added user existence check in token validation
- Clear error messages for token issues

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Database Security**:
   - Ensure database connection is using SSL/TLS
   - Configure database with least privilege access
   - Implement regular database backups

2. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Add security event logging
   - Implement monitoring for suspicious activities
   - Configure alerts for security events

3. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep all dependencies up-to-date
   - Regularly check for security vulnerabilities with npm audit
   - Update security configurations as needed

4. **API Documentation**:
   - Document security expectations and requirements
   - Include security considerations in API documentation

5. **Security Testing**:
   - Implement regular penetration testing
   - Add security-focused test cases
   - Consider using automated security scanning tools

## Testing Security Measures

Security tests have been added to verify that implemented measures are working correctly:

- XSS protection tests
- Rate limiting tests
- Security headers tests
- Input validation tests

These tests can be run with:

```bash
npm test tests/test-security.js
npm test tests/test-validation.js
```

## Conclusion

The security improvements implemented provide protection against common web vulnerabilities and follow security best practices. Regular security audits and updates should be performed to ensure ongoing protection.
